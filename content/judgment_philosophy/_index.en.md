*<h3> Who I Am </h3>*

This section is not a biography but the contour of my thought process (if interested, you can see my brief bio [here](https://snowballassociates.com/profile)). Instead, it reflects the lens through which I perceive the world: the operating system behind every analysis and judgment you will find on this website.

I start from a simple, unshakable belief: "phenomena are modes of essence, and every possibility originates from reason," as remarked in [my book][ref1] (52). Understanding comes from capturing the underlying structure, *i.e.*, the paradigm. Like an architect who sees the load-bearing walls and foundations beneath the facade or a physician who diagnoses the root cause of a disease rather than just treating its symptoms, I search for the fundamental 'why' behind any event. Data and narratives may function as points of entry, but not final destinations.

To uncover this *why*, I strive to break the artificial walls between academic disciplines or professional fields. A problem in finance might have its roots in ideology, and a societal trend could be best explained by a quantitative model. By integrating normative reasoning―the world of *ought to be*―with empirical analysis―the world of *as is*―I seek to assemble a more robust, holistic picture of reality. This approach is modular; I select the right tool for the job, not the most familiar one, which has stemmed from my first Freshman Studies class on Galileo, *"Believe what you see, not vice versa."* This is one of few valuable lessons I learned from 100-week college classes.

The purpose of this section is to make records so that I can later track what I thought at specific moment and to share my foundational code, which I believe to be helpful to better understand the logic behind my work—whether it is a market call, policy analysis, or philosophical inquiry.

- **[Diary][ref2]**: What I did & Whom I met; written 100% in Korean as it is solely personal usage. You can try AI translation if interested, but it will most likely to fail to convey the original meaning due to the innate intricacy of the Korean language (*e.g.*, countless metaphors aligned with four dialects and internet memes; the grammar structure seemingly very flexible yet requiring extreme rigor, such that subject and object are very frequently omitted in a sentence while even a single letter or punctuation mark can completely invert the original meaning). <br><br>

- **[Passing Thoughts][ref3]**: Brief judgment calls; written mostly in Korean, due to the intrinsic linguistic constraints of the English language in fully capturing subtle implications, nuances, or connotations inherent in abstract concepts. For example:
    - justice *vs.* righteousness ~ 정의(正義); *díkē*; *aequitas* *vs.* 공의(公義); *dikaiosynē*; *iustitia*
    - the people *vs.* nationals *vs.* citizens ~ 인민(人民); *anthrōpoi*[^1] *vs.* 국민(國民); *dēmos* *vs.* 시민(市民); *politēs*

Noteworthy thoughts will be developed into rather formal writings in academic English and posted in other sections, so no worries!

[^1]: There is no direct ancient Greek equivalent capturing full nuance/context of 인민(人民); *anthrōpoi* is closer to a general *people* (*i.e.*, human beings) than *the people* (*i.e.*, a populace or collective body, mostly suitable in political/legal philosophy context), while it is very tricky in daily usage to differentiate 'people' from 'the people' in English.
