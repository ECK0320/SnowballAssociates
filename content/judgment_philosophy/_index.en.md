*<h3> Who I Am </h3>*

This section is not a biography but the contour of my thought process. Instead, it reflects the lens through which I perceive the world: the operating system behind every analysis and judgment you will find on this website.

I start from a simple, unshakable belief: "phenomena are modes of essence, and every possibility originates from reason," as remarked in [my book][ref1] (52). Understanding comes from capturing the underlying structure, *i.e.*, the paradigm. Like an architect who sees the load-bearing walls and foundations beneath the facade or a physician who diagnoses the root cause of a disease rather than just treating its symptoms, I search for the fundamental 'why' behind any event. Data and narratives may function as points of entry, but not final destinations.

To uncover this *why*, I strive to break the artificial walls between academic disciplines or professional fields. A problem in finance might have its roots in ideology, and a societal trend could be best explained by a quantitative model. By integrating normative reasoning―the world of *ought to be*―with empirical analysis―the world of *as is*―I seek to assemble a more robust, holistic picture of reality. This approach is modular; I select the right tool for the job, not the most familiar one, which has stemmed from my first Freshman Studies class on Galileo, *"Believe what you see, not vice versa."* This is one of few valuable lessons I learned from 100-week college classes.

The purpose of this section is to make records so that I can later track what I thought at specific moment and to share my foundational code, which I believe to be helpful to better understand the logic behind my work—whether it is a market call, policy analysis, or philosophical inquiry.

- **[Diary][ref2]**: An archive of personal journals in Korean, maintained for a small group of long-time subscribers. Access is restricted. <br><br>

- **[Passing Thoughts][ref3]**: Brief judgment calls; written mostly in Korean to fully capture subtle implications, nuances, or connotations inherent in abstract concepts. For example:
    - justice *vs.* righteousness ~ 정의(正義); *díkē*; *aequitas* *vs.* 공의(公義); *dikaiosynē*; *iustitia*
    - the people *vs.* nationals *vs.* citizens ~ 인민(人民); *anthrōpoi*[^1] *vs.* 국민(國民); *dēmos* *vs.* 시민(市民); *politēs*

Noteworthy thoughts, given that my curiosity is piqued enough, will be developed into formal essays in the **[V. Works][ref4]** section.

[^1]: There is no direct ancient Greek equivalent capturing full nuance/context of 인민(人民); *anthrōpoi* is closer to a general *people* (*i.e.*, human beings) than *the people* (*i.e.*, a populace or collective body, mostly suitable in political/legal philosophy context), while it is very tricky in daily usage to differentiate 'people' from 'the people' in English.
