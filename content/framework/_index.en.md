title: "How I Think"
---

My cognitive framework, which underpins my judgment philosophy, has been profoundly shaped by an unconventional academic trajectory and extensive real-world adversities. This journey has not merely presented challenges but has served as a crucible, forging a distinct methodology for approaching complex problems.

Beginning immediately after high school, I embarked on a path of unwavering self-reliance, simultaneously managing a small business—my freelance consulting and investment practice—for over a decade while pursuing my education. This period, characterized by intensive self-funding and a rigorous balance of demanding work (10-15+ hours daily) and studies, cultivated an unparalleled capacity for resource optimization, resilient decision-making under scarcity, and strategic time management from on-the-ground experience across various industries. It instilled a deep understanding of practical exigencies and the tangible impact of theoretical applications.

My academic pursuits at undergrad, completing nine 500+ level classes and independently authoring two acclaimed theses in political-legal theory and mathematics-economics while graduating two terms early with honors, demonstrate a unique blend of intellectual curiosity, interdisciplinary synthesis, and rapid mastery of complex subjects. My academic trajectory, marked by intermittent enrollment and extended breaks totaling 10+ years—including a significant period dedicated to personal recovery and intensified professional engagements (2018-2024)—became a crucible for strategic self-reflection and diversified practical application, further honing my entrepreneurial drive and versatile problem-solving skills across finance, strategy, and policy.

Such lived experience, far from a conventional academic progression, has fundamentally informed my approach to judgment and analysis. It has imbued me with a rigorous, reality-tested framework that goes beyond theoretical abstraction. I approach every problem with a deep appreciation for systemic vulnerabilities, a nuanced understanding of human incentives under pressure, and a pragmatic yet ethically grounded perspective. This allows me to synthesize diverse information, identify core drivers, and formulate solutions that are not only analytically sound but also robust against real-world complexities and uncertainty. My method is thus rooted in a constant interplay between conceptual rigor and practical discernment, enabling me to navigate ambiguous situations with both clarity and an adaptive strategic outlook.
