title: "Judgment Philosophy"

*<h3> Who I Am </h3>*

This reflects the lens through which I perceive the world. It is the operating system behind every analysis and judgment you will find on this site. It’s not a biography but the contour of my thought process.

I start from a simple, unshakable belief: "phenomena are modes of essence, and every possibility originates from reason," as remarked in [my book][ref1]. Understanding comes from capturing the underlying structure. Like an architect who sees the load-bearing walls and foundations beneath the facade or a physician who diagnoses the root cause of a disease rather than just treating its symptoms, I search for the fundamental 'why' behind any event. Data and narratives may function as points of entry, but not final destinations.

To uncover this *why*, I strive to break the artificial walls between academic disciplines or professional fields. A problem in finance might have its roots in ideology, and a societal trend could be best explained by a mathematical model. By integrating normative reasoning―the world of *ought to be*―with empirical analysis―the world of *as is*―I seek to assemble a more robust, holistic picture of reality. This approach is modular; I select the right tool for the job, not the most familiar one, which stems from my first Freshman Studies class on Galileo, "Believe what you see, not vice versa." This is one of few valuable lessons I learned from 100-week college classes.

The purpose of this section is to make records so that I can later track what I thought at specific moment and to share my foundational code, which I believe to be helpful to better understand the logic behind my work—whether it’s a market call, a policy analysis, or a philosophical inquiry.
