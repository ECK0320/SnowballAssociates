*<h3> What I See </h3>*

This section is a curated archive of structural analyses and interpretive commentaries on the deep patterns that shape politics, society, culture, and economy across regions, but mainly on the US and Northeast Asia.

Unlike direct buy/sell calls, the commentaries here focus on the foundational architectures, systemic relationships, and emergent trends that are manifested through the intricate interplay between policy, institutional structures, and prevailing ideological currents. The world is a complex adaptive system, and these commentaries trace the causations behind its trajectory driven by hidden forces―such as the Invisible Hand and Mr. Market.

Each entry explores how collective forces—governments, institutions, markets, and ideology—interact to produce macro-level outcomes and micro-level experiences. Entries here begin as intuition-driven hypotheses formulated by connecting disparate, scattered ideas. This sketchy analysis draft will be synthesized into a full picture when enough data and time are secured and, most importantly, curiosity is sufficiently piqued.

When these initial hypotheses that distill the essential dynamics at play are rigorously tested with data and developed into formal reports, they graduate to the [V. Works][ref1] section for those seeking larger-scale research. This commentary log therefore serves as the wellspring for more exhaustive analysis for organizing principles and underlying forces—sometimes hidden, sometimes overt—that shape societies, drive markets, and shape the human world, which in sum represents an effort to identify the fundamental [*why*][ref2] behind emerging trends.

- **[Macro Trends][ref3]**  
  Analyses of politics and the economy at scale, based on national and global interplays between systems or institutional designs, such as government policies, international relations, systemic changes in political economy, or paradigm shifts: how structural shifts in nations, markets, and industries realign collective outcomes. <br><br>
  
- **[Micro Trends][ref4]**  
  Interpretations of society and culture in motion, based on personal experience and cultural phenomena: how macro changes shape cultural norms, social values, consumption patterns, psychological landscapes, and the rhythms of daily existence that filter down into the lived realities of individuals and communities.
