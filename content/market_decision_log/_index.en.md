title: "Market Decision Log"

*<h3> What I Thought </h3>*

This section is an unvarnished record of my engagement with market dynamics. It is not a collection of theoretical *what-ifs* but a chronicle of *real-time judgments* where my own capital and direct accountability were at stake.

My thinking process follows the methodology which I call **3W1H**, whose disciplines are elaborated in [my book][ref1] (48-51). This four-step logic governs every decision, not necessarily limited to investing, that you will find on this website:

1. **What**: Grasp all available data and information without omission or distortion.

2. **Why**: Identify the core rationale for choosing an approach, grounded in data and narratives.

3. **How**: Apply the method best suited to the rationale.

4. **So What**: Arrive at a conclusion; for example, an investment decision―whether to buy, sell, or hold.

Each transaction or market call posted in this category includes my reasoning, decision, result, and---just as importantly---a brief retrospective to review what worked, what didn’t, and why. This structure may show not only *what* I did and *why* but also *how* my decisions are formulated in a systematic, reproducible process.

While each trade or recommendation here contains the core logic of a decision, the exhaustive data and in-depth fundamental & quantitative analyses are archived in the [V. Works][ref2] section (light-form and full-form reports). I frequently utilize technical analysis---*e.g.*, moving average---for short-term trading, and transactions that are purely based on technical analysis are not explained in the Works section.

- **[Transactions][ref3]**: A chronological ledger of actual trades, which shows the timing (`entry/exit`), direction (`long/short/close`), outcome (`profit/loss`), and quick post-trade reflection. This is the archive of what I did in the market and how those decisions played out. <br><br>

- **[Market Calls][ref4]**: My real-time, time-stamped public recommendations (`buy/sell/hold`) on specific assets or sectors. Each post states its thesis, rationale, grounds, and perspective at that moment.
