*My investment research integrates macro, political, and structural signals into narrative-driven judgments aligned with asset-level valuation. I do not build models to explain prices; I build frameworks to diagnose noise and assess mispricings.*

> This posting is a post-mortem analysis of the [August underweight/hold call on PWR](https://www.snowballassociates.com/market_decision_log/calls/2025/250801_followup_pwr-underweight/), verifying the previous thesis and initiating a new tactical **SELL/UNDERWEIGHT** call.

## I. Ex-Ante

| Metric             | Ex-Ante (2025-08-01)                   | Upside/Downside | Rationale                                     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| NDX Target         | **25,279.5–26,162.83**                 |  **+9.3–13.1%** | Strong sentiment; technical analysis          |
| PWR Key Supports   | **$365.88** (band **$351.07–$378.65**) |       **~−10%** | September cut uncertainty; technical analysis |
| PWR Trigger Points | **$424.94** and **$456.07**            |  **+4.6–12.3%** | Technical analysis                            |


### 1. Strategy
Based on fundamentals and technicals, I treated PWR’s **$424.94** ATH (7/25) as a short-term ceiling and recommended **tactical underweight or hold** into the **Sep 16–18 FOMC**.


### 2. Outlook
I assumed the **90-day U.S.–China tariff truce (signed 2025-04-09)** would be extended in August. The anticipated September rate cut still required confirmation.

After the 7/25 ATH of **$424.94**, the stock failed to break through it and turned lower by **2025-07-31 (H $423.50 / C $406.13 / L $399.07)**. Despite the price being 57%+ above my comps-based Strong Bull case at that time, there was no imminent technical signal of a collapse, and the broader market trend remained up. Net: **UNDERWEIGHT/HOLD** into the September FOMC.


### 3. Estimates
I projected: (1) **NDX** potential resistance at **25,279.5–26,162.83** (**+9–13%**); (2) **PWR** short-term support at **$365.88** (band **$351.07–$378.65**, ~**10%** drawdown risk); (3) a rebound attempt first at **$424.94**, then **$456.07** if the resistance of $424.94 is broken.

| **Stance into Sep FOMC (9/16–18)** | If already in → **Underweight**; if not in → **Hold**                                      | **9/5** intraday **$363.10** & close **$372.50**; **9/17** intraday **$373.40** & close **$376.01**; rebound began **9/18** |   **Validated**  |
| **NDX Projection**                 | Long-term uptrend; greatest upper bound **25,279.5–26,162.83** (**+9.3–13.1%**)            | Printed **24,978.56 (10/6)** (**+8.0%** from the 7/31 level); now **24,840.23**                                             | **Right So Far** |
| **PWR Projection**                 | <span class="quote">"May correct to **$365.88**"</span>; support **$351.07–$378.65**       | **9/5** intraday **$363.10** (**−0.76%** below $365.88), close **$372.50** (within the support band)                        | **Proven Right** |

| **Tariff Truce Extension**         | <span class="quote">"**The truce will be extended in August for another 90 days**"</span>  | The extension for another 90 days was announced 8.5 hours before the termination of the 4/9 truce                           | **Proven Right** |

#### Note / Gap

- **Target _vs._ Trough**: Forecast **$365.88** _vs._ Actual **$363.10** (intraday; **−0.76%** deviation) before the rebound.
- **Sequence**: Initial touch within **$351.07–$378.65** on **8/13** (**$369.06**) → **8/20** (**$367.90**) → **9/2** (**$366.35**) → **9/5** (**$363.10**) → **9/17** (**$373.40**) → rebound from **9/18** (**+3.89%** close).
- **Current state (10/8 close)**: **$421.51**, after **ATH $434.39 (10/7 intraday)**; oscillating below the **7/25 prior high $424.94**.


### 2. Modified View
The thesis has been **directionally validated**: downside to **$363.10 (9/5)**, rebound post-FOMC (**9/18**), subsequent **ATH $434.39 (10/7 intraday)**, and consolidation around **$422**. I therefore **close the prior tactical underweight call**. My **fundamental outlook is unchanged** given the tight tracking between ex-ante estimates and realized prints.


### 3. Additional View
Since the September cut, the market has begun to pay marginally more attention to the real economy fundamentals. However, **no singular bearish catalyst** sufficient to trigger a major equity drawdown has emerged ***yet***.

Base case: the market **continues to grind higher** toward **NDX 25,279.5–26,162.83**, with PWR’s second target at **$456.07** still in play.

Given the confluence of the deteriorating real economy and the limited justification for the current valuation by either fundamentals or technical analysis, I am initiating a **third TACTICAL SELL/UNDERWEIGHT call** when PWR’s stock price enters the target range of **$434.39–$456.07.**

-----

## III. Sidenote
A first material risk catalyst could originate in crypto markets. Bitcoin’s upper resistance is estimated to be between **$109,607 and $125,924**; major coins either stopped rising or started declining after Bitcoin’s ATH of $124,713.60 marked on 2025-10-06.

The real economy is clearly staggering—which will be analyzed in detail in a separate article continuing the discussion from [the outlook on a September cut](https://www.snowballassociates.com/structural_commentary/macro_trends/2025/250906_september_cut_and_its_aftermath/)—as briefly indicated by the recent October ISM PMIs (Manufacturing 49.1, Services 50.0). If the crypto catalyst does not materialize, there are three major potential triggers on the real economy side:
1. Non-Farm Payrolls report, whose release has been postponed due to the recent administration shutdown (originally scheduled for 2025-10-03).
2. 3Q25 U.S. GDP Advance Estimate (scheduled for 2025-10-30).
3. The actual termination of the extended U.S.-China tariff truce or Trump's threats to terminate it (due to expire on 2025-11-10 at 00:01 EST).

## IV. Conclusion
With the stock market, crypto market, and PWR's stock price all pressing against their theoretical upper bounds, compounded by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions increasingly evidenced by key indicators, I recommend a **SELL/UNDERWEIGHT on PWR into the $434.39–$456.07 zone**.

Contrary to the previous underweight calls, I do not recommend increasing equity exposure afterwards unless either an unusually strong growth in the near future is newly expected for PWR or a clear, sustained rebound in the real economy emerges.
