*My investment research integrates macro, political, and structural signals into narrative-driven judgments aligned with asset-level valuation. I do not build models to explain prices; I build frameworks to diagnose noise and assess mispricings.*

> This posting is a post-mortem analysis of the [March underweight call on PWR](https://www.snowballassociates.com/works/light_format/2025/250319_quantaservices_pwr_investment_thesis/), verifying the previous thesis and initiating a new tactical UNDERWEIGHT/HOLD call.

## I. Ex-Ante

| Metric          | Ex-Ante (2025-03-19)    | Upside/Downside | Rationale                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| NDX MDD         | 16,573.34p              | -23.3%          | Sentiment unwinding         |
| PWR Target Price| $237.73                 | -11.7%          | Comps-based Base Case       |
| PWR EPS (FY25E) | $6.55 (Base)            | +8.6%           | Scenario Analysis Base Case |

This section summarizes the original thesis as of 2025-03-19.

### 1. Strategy
Based on fundamental and technical analyses, I viewed the PWR's closing price of $269.36 (as of Feb 21, 2025) as exuberance, which led me to recommend raising cash for the short-term strategy: **Tactical Underweight** (1--2 month horizon).

### 2. Outlook
I was <span class = "quote">"unusually certain"</span> that the market correction of 15%+ was imminent, which could result in a sharp decline in stock price for cyclicals such as PWR. While maintaining a constructive view on the U.S. electricity grid infrastructure industry and on its primary beneficiary PWR in the long run, I recommended reducing PWR's exposure to hedge the political uncertainty and economic risks. The market---particularly tech-related sectors---was evidently dictated by the sentiment, so it looked most rational to raise cash and wait until the political uncertainty (*i.e.*, tariff threats) subsided.

I assumed that **an inflection point for the stock market would be Apr 2**, <span class = "append">so-called _"Liberation Day"_</span>, the deadline for additional reciprocal tariffs on Asian manufacturing countries. My perspective was that Trump's political actions were a political theater rather than true diplomatic initiatives; while the tariff would be imposed, as was during his first term, its figures would likely be *negotiated* down to some range unsatisfactory yet acceptable to trading partners. Trump is not a politician but a political businessman running the most 'monopolitic' enterprise in the world, and given the majority of his political advocates, I assumed that he would not enforce directives that might damage his political capital.

All things considered, I recommended re-entering the long position on PWR or ETFs related to the U.S. electricity grid infrastructure, once the policy uncertainty is resolved after the April tariff deadlines and 1Q25 GDP release.

### 3. Estimates
Should the sentiment unwind and the exuberance dissipate, I predicted that (1) the greatest lower bound for the **Nasdaq 100 (NDX)** was 16,573.34p, **potential MDD of ~23%**; (2) the target price for **PWR**---<span class = "append">comps-based Base Case</span>---was $237.73, a view of **~12% drawdown**; (3) **forward diluted EPS** for PWR, derived from proprietary scenario analysis and OLS regression models, ranges from **$6.43--$7.09** (Bear $6.43; Base $6.55; Bull $6.94; Strong Bull $7.09).

|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------:|
|   NDX Projection               | Major correction risk in case the sentiment unwinds; **greatest lower bound: 16,573.3p (-23.5%)**  | 52W intraday Low of **16,542.2p (-23.3%)** (2025-04-08); **-15.5%** after the so-called "Liberation Day"        | **Proven Right** |
|   PWR Projection               | **Target Price: $237.7 (-11.7%)**; comps-based Base Case                                           | 52W closing Low of **$236.7 (-12.1%)**; intraday trough at **$227.1 (-15.7%)**                                  | **Proven Right** |

|   Tariff Threats               | **Key overhangs** in Feb--Apr; tariff imposition with figures negotiated down                      | **Uncertainty materialized**, drawdown followed (Feb 20--Apr 7); Policy overhangs cleared, rebound followed     | **Proven Right** |
|   FY25E EBITDA Growth          | **YoY +22.6--34.7%**; EPS: **$6.43--7.09**.                                                        | Company guidance: **EBITDA YoY +20.2--26.4%**, EPS: **$6.47--$7.07**; TTM EPS: (2Q25A) **$6.46**.               |   **Validated**  |
> *EPS refers to diluted EPS.*

#### Note/Gap
- A significant correction occurred over seven weeks until Apr 7, when NDX touched its intraday low at 16,542.20p.
  - **NDX dropped roughly 15.5% after Apr 2** (Apr 2 closing 19,581.78p → Apr 7 low 16,542.20p)

- Difference between my projection and outcome
  - Technical analysis-based MDD for NDX (-23.5%) *vs.* NDX 52W intraday Low (-23.3%): **0.19p%** difference
  - Comps-based TP for PWR ($237.73; Base Case) *vs.* PWR 52W closing Low ($236.71): **0.43%p** difference
  - IVE model estimate for PWR ($221.88; Base Case) *vs.* PWR 52W intraday Low ($227.08): **2.34%p** difference

- *New* Tariff Impositions
  - A 20% Fentanyl Tariff on Chinese imports was enacted from February to March 2025.
  - A 25% tariff was imposed on imported steel and aluminum, effective March 12, 2025.
  - A 25% tariff was imposed on all imported cars, effective Apr 3, 2025
  - A **10% Reciprocal Tariff was imposed** on all imported goods, **with no exemptions for allies**, effective April 5, 2025.
  - A 54% tariff was imposed on Chinese de minimis shipments, effective May 14, 2025.  

- Tariff *Negotiations*
  - **A 90-day tariff pause** was enacted from April 9 to July 8.
  - The US-China tariff truce was signed on Apr 9, 2025; **the previously announced 125% reciprocal tariff was adjusted downward to 10%**, reducing the cumulative tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 55%. I am very certain that **the truce would be extended in August for another 90 days**.
> <span class = "append">It seems necessary to conduct an economic research to examine how the newly imposed tariffs would affect the current inflation.</span>


### 2. Modified View
My original thesis overall has proven directionally validated: the stock fulfilled the downside of $237 (2025-03-10), then subsequently rallied to a new ATH at $425 (2025-07-25), and is now near $406 (P/E≈62.8 on TTM diluted EPS). Therefore, **the previous tactical underweight call is now closed**, and **my fundamental outlook is unchanged** as the ex-ante estimates closely track actuals.


### 3. Additional View
PWR's 2Q25 [earnings call](https://investors.quantaservices.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/379/quanta-services-reports-second-quarter-2025-results) shows that the circumstance this year tends to be between my **Bear and Base Cases**: diluted EPS of $6.43--$6.55 (FY25E), **assuming annual EBITDA growth of +22.6--24.8%**.
  - PWR's 2Q25A diluted EPS is $6.46 (TTM), indicating YoY +20.6% and HoH +21.0%. Given its past earnings[^1], 3Q25 diluted EPS must be greater than $2.04---*i.e.*, YoY +4.6% or more---to beat my Base Case, which seems likely achievable. If diluted EPS continues to grow at YoY +20% or more, then TTM diluted EPS for 3Q25E will reach $6.87+, closer to my Bull Case of $6.94.
  - According to PWR, they expect their <span class = "quote">"EBITDA to range between $2.50 billion and $2.63 billion"</span> and <span class = "quote">"diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $6.47 and $7.07."</span> This means **EBITDA growth of YoY +20.2--26.4%, close to my Bear--Base Cases (+22.6--24.8%).** However, its diluted EPS growth of YoY +6.6--17.2% falls under all my scenarios, from Bear Case (YoY +6.6%) to Strong Bull Case (YoY +17.6%), requiring further research to identify the causes for the discrepancy between EBITDA growth and EPS growth scenarios.
    > The divergence between the company's steady operational growth (EBITDA) and its more volatile bottom-line outlook (EPS guidance) is revealing. The low-end (Bear Case) of the wide EPS range likely reflects ongoing margin pressures such as rising commodity price. In contrast, the high-end (Base-to-Strong Bull Cases) likely points to potential operating leverage such as a slowdown in D&A growth following its five-year elevated CAPEX.
  - *The core problem, again, is whether this growth, even if robust, can justify the current valuation.*

The stock’s current valuation requires reassessment---*i.e.*, whether forward earnings momentum can justify the current **TTM P/E of 62.8**---under a new framework after incorporating the latest 1Q25A and 2Q25A results, which were not captured in the March call. Given that only does technical analysis partially justify the current price, I am initiating a **second TACTICAL UNDERWEIGHT** (or HOLD, if you have not yet established a position) until the upcoming FOMC meeting (Sep 16--17) provides more clarity on the inflation trajectory.


## III. Sidenote
I actively adopt technical analysis when the market is heavily predicated on the sentiment, by which fundamentals become futile to validate the market value. I see no fundamentals-related rationale to justify a P/E of 61 for an infrastructure stock as of now.

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, (1) the resistance zone for NDX screens at **25,279.5p--26,162.83p**, indicating **9.3--13.1% upside** from the current 23,128.12p; (2) for PWR, I am monitoring **$456** as a breakout trigger and **$366 ($351--378)** as key supports.
- *Theoretically* speaking, the greatest upper bound of PWR's share price is $688.73.
    - Assuming that the new ATH of $424.94 were its short-term ceiling, I predict that the current stock price ($406.13) may correct down to **$365.88 (downside of 9.9%) with the support range of $351.07--378.65**---<span class = "append">theoretically, its greatest lower bound is $330.58, but I am not inclined to this scenario. The current optimistic sentiment does not seem to unwind at least until October, the earliest time to check the effect of the (expected) September cut</span>. It is worth noting that even the low-end ($351.07) of this support range is **still ~57% higher than my comps-based Strong Bull Case** ($258.47).
    - PWR's 52W high as well as new record high is $424.94, marked a week ago. As the optimistic sentiment over the whole stock market is persistent, I expect at least one more rebound following the expected ~10% correction. If PWR's stock price breaks through---after the correction---the ATH of $424.94 and then a projected resistance of $456.07, then it can rise as high as $549.76; the _**THEORETICAL**_ upper limit is $688.73, which I expect to be reached in the long run, but not in the short horizon.
